getting the raw html data from the micro websites process the html to obtain product and user information extract various reports out of the vistor tracking information and export the information for further processing Role Responsibilities Move all crawl data flat files generated from various micro sites to HDFS for further processing Sqoop implementation for interaction with database Write Map Reduce scripts to process the data file Create hive tables to store the processed data in tabular formats Reports creation from hive data Project 3 company PRGX India Private Limited Pune description Team Size 15 Environment Informatica 9 5 Oracle11g UNIX Project Description Pfizer Inc is an American global pharmaceutical corporation headquartered in New York City The main objective of the project is to build a Development Data Repository for Pfizer Inc Because all the downstream application are like Etrack TSP database S SADMS GFS GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system DDR process extracts all clinical pre clinical study product subject sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS CDSS RCM PRC E CLINICAL EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application Role Responsibilities To understand analyze the requirement documents and resolve the queries To design Informatica mappings by using various basic transformations like Filter Router Source qualifier Lookup etc and advance transformations like Aggregators Joiner Sorters and so on Perform cross Unit and Integration testing for mappings developed within the team Reporting bugs and bug fixing Create workflow batches and set the session dependencies Implemented Change Data Capture using mapping parameters SCD and SK generation Developed Mapplet reusable transformations to populate the data into data warehouse Created Sessions Worklets using workflow Manager to load the data into the Target
